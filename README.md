## Introduction
With increasing global aging, falls are frequent among older people (Soffer et al., 2024). According to the World Health Organization (2007), about 28% to 35% of people aged 65 years and older experience at least one fall per year. This is highly susceptible to problems such as bone fractures and brain injuries in the elderly, which seriously affect their health and quality of life (Maruf et al., 2025). Especially if timely assistance is not available after a fall, the risk of mortality and complications increases significantly. Therefore, the development of a system that can monitor and warn of falls in real-time is important for the safety and health of the elderly.  

Based on this, this project proposes a fall detection and alert system (FallWatch). It collects motion data through a device fixed at the waist and uses deep learning algorithms to recognize both falling and normal standing postures. Once a fall is detected, the system will sound an alarm through a buzzer to alert nearby personnel to respond, providing more timely help and safety for the elderly. Initial tests show that the system can achieve almost 100% detection accuracy, validating its feasibility in real-time monitoring scenarios.
